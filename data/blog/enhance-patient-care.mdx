As a chiropractor, you know how all of the aspects of a patient’s health and lifestyle affect their musculoskeletal system and overall health and wellness.

Nutrition is no exception. In fact, you’re in good company if you’re a doctor of chiropractic already incorporating health and wellness into your practice. Studies show that natural products such as dietary supplements remain the most common complementary health approach in the United States, according to the NIH’s National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). One study found that 97 percent of chiropractors give nutritional and dietary recommendations, making it a matter of course in their treatment and maintenance plans.

What’s also telling is that more than half of these practitioners did not limit their nutritional counseling to patients with musculoskeletal disorders. The scope extended to chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, obesity, diabetes and allergies. At the same time, many expressed an interest in furthering their study of nutrition through continuing education.

At RX2Live, we recognize that patients need solutions to fit their individual needs. Genetic blueprinting and supplements are one way to enhance your offerings and provide a holistic approach to care. A one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work with supplements or any aspect of medical care, which is why we can help you deliver customized supplement recommendations to your patients. Our professional-grade supplements are designed to help patients achieve the optimal health results that our bodies need. And they are backed by quality and science, medically and scientifically designed to deliver optimal micronutrients and macronutrients.

All of the RX2Live solutions are designed to improve patient care and generate additional revenue. We have compiled a solution that can transition chiropractors from surviving to thriving. What’s more, the RX2Live solution can be achieved without adding expensive staff, or even patients. To learn more and to see how RX2Live can help you, call: (240) 380-2180
