Thermal imaging technology is used for a number of purposes including construction and military applications, but did you know that it can also provide critical health insights?

Sports physicians, physical therapists and even family practitioners are using this cutting-edge tool to give their patients accurate data and information via heat sensing.

When parts of the body are in pain or suffering from inflammation, thermal imaging is able to pick up these metabolic “hot spots,” a process that diagnostic imaging technologies like CT scans and X-rays are incapable of.

Due to its unique ability to monitor a patient’s entire body function, thermography is being used to treat and diagnose a number of common ailments including:

- Inflammation
- Chronic pain
- Arthritis
- Fibromyalgia
- Carpal tunnel syndrome
- Nerve injuries
- And the potential is there for even further applications!

What’s even more exciting is that thermal imaging is completely safe. Most scanning technologies expose patients to radiation, but not thermography. The process is simple, pain-free and can be used on individuals of any age; young or old.

If you are a physician or chiropractor that prides yourself on offering your clients access to helpful and effective high-tech treatments, it’s time to consider adding thermal imaging to your repertoire.
