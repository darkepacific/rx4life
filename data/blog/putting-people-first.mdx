Sometimes, the truth is right there in front of us, but we don’t know how to confront it. For example, treating patients with patience, respect and understanding is fundamental to healthcare. Sounds easy enough, right?

As data, metrics and outcomes seem to take center stage in the healthcare industry, the need for patient-centered methodologies is growing. If patients don’t feel comfortable, they will be less likely to seek help and be open about their health concerns.

Charts can’t replace cultural competency and technology is no substitute for human-to-human interaction. In terms of communication, only patients can provide the information providers need to ensure the quality of care.

There are three easy ways to make patients feel respected. Use these three tips as the guidelines for your communication practices.

1. Patients want to feel respected, understood and heard. Take time to listen to patients’ questions and concerns. Some may not be as forthcoming, however, so make sure you end each appointment with an opportunity for them to ask questions. Ask to make sure everything you relayed to them in clear and if all their needs were met at the appointment.

2. Patients pick up on both verbal and nonverbal interactions. Allowing a patient to fully explain him or herself without interruption communicates that his or her needs are important and valid. A smile, nod and open posture tell patients that their healthcare professional is an active team member in addressing the cause for their visit.

3. Eye contact is a powerful tool. Though it sounds simple, in an age where patients’ concerns often need to be entered into an online system, maintaining eye contact with patients has become increasingly difficult. As much as time will allow, keeping the focus on the patient as opposed to the computer screen will go a long way in terms of quality care.

Although data and numbers are a vital part of the healthcare industry, patients certainly do not want to feel like just another number when seeking medical help. Taking care to remember that patients are people first, leads to taking good care of patients.
