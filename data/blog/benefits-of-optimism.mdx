A longer and happier life. Better health. Less stress. Science tells us that there’s a whole host of benefits to looking on the bright side. But what if you tend to see the glass as half empty instead of half full? Can you learn to think more positively?

Research suggests the answer is a resounding yes. Here are five simple yet effective ways to develop a more positive outlook on life:

### Make time for meditation. 
Research suggests that those who meditate daily display more positive emotions than those who don’t. And we’re not talking about saying ‘om’ for an hour. Even just a few minutes of meditation a day can help you dramatically boost your mood and facilitate positive thinking. The best part? Meditation is a simple thing to do — click here to get started — and doesn’t require any special equipment or a gym membership!

### Write it down. 
Keeping a journal is a great way to reflect on pleasant memories and work through not-so-pleasant experiences, all of which can elevate your mood and outlook.

### Have some fun. 
All work and no play is no fun — not to mention hazardous to your health. When was the last time you intentionally carved out time to have fun? It could be playing with your dog or watching your favorite show. There is even research that shows people who make time for themselves are much more positive and productive in their jobs.

### Make time for self-care. 
Self-care is critical. Carving out time to take care of your own needs can help boost your health and happiness.

Show some gratitude. In a study, researchers discovered incredible benefits to writing down what you have to be thankful for on at least a weekly basis. They asked groups of people to write a few sentences each week. One group focused on what they had to be thankful for, a second group focused on annoying things that had happened throughout the week and a third group was asked to simply write about things that happened during the week — good or bad. Those who were asked to write about what they had to be thankful for after 10 weeks were more optimistic, exercised more and felt better about their lives.
