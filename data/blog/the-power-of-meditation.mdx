“The time to relax is when you don’t have time for it.” ―Sydney J. Harris

It’s no secret that reducing your stress levels can improve your health and well-being. We know what you’re thinking: Easier said than done. Right?

Meditation is a simple yet [powerful way](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/317986?utm_source=s5_mobile_site&utm_medium=mobile&utm_campaign=s5_89691#Six-mindfulness-techniques-to-try-today) for physicians to reduce stress, anxiety, and improve overall health and well-being. It might be something you have considered or maybe you’ve never pictured yourself doing it. Maybe you think you don’t have the time to meditate or anywhere to do it. In reality, you can fit meditation into almost any schedule and reap the benefits of this ancient practice.

Several studies, such as one by the University of Rochester Medical Center, have shown that meditation can help physicians and their patients. The Rochester study, published in Academic Medicine journal, found that meditation helped reduce symptoms of stress and burnout, which enabled the physicians in the study to deliver better and more compassionate care.

## Here are some steps that can help you become a meditation master:

1. Make room in your life for it: When meditating, it is important to set aside a specific time of the day just for this purpose. Make it a priority.
2. Make yourself comfortable: If your body isn’t comfortable, it’s going to be extremely difficult to focus your thoughts on anything else. Find a cozy chair, sit on the floor or even lay on your back — whatever makes you feel most relaxed.
3. Focus on your breathing: Focusing on your breathing will help you get your heart rate down and relax your body. Take deep breaths! It also will help you keep your thoughts from wandering onto other things. Try inhaling through your nose and exhaling out of your mouth. You can also focus on how deeply you can breathe. Speaking of breathing, here are some simple mindful breathing exercises to try.
4. Get some help: One of the biggest obstacles to using meditation as a health and wellness tool is getting started. Many people feel intimidated and/or worried they won’t be able to figure out how to do it correctly. Try one of these free apps to get started. UCLA Mindful, for example, has a Getting Started section, which can help.
5. Experiment: The most important thing about meditation is finding out what works best for you. Try to experiment with different techniques and guided meditations, keeping your eyes open or shutting them, being indoors or outdoors. The time of day might also impact the overall experience.
