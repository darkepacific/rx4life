Chronic illnesses cost the U.S. economy more than '$'1 trillion annually, and that number is expected to balloon to '$'6 trillion in the coming decades. At RX2Live, our Workplace Well-Being and Six-Week Challenge programs have helped companies nationwide improve the health and productivity of their employees and reduce healthcare costs, claims and absenteeism.

These programs, when done right, have been shown to help employees prevent a wide variety of chronic conditions and better manage existing conditions. A recent study by Brigham Young University found that businesses saved $3.27 for every dollar they spent on employee wellness.

Not surprisingly, corporate wellness programs have seen broader acceptance nationally as an effective — and proven — way to save money for both the employee and employer. Our focus at Rx2Live is on helping you and your employees become more healthy through a wide variety of health and wellness tools and services. Here are some of the benefits of our workplace wellness program:

Reduced sick leave and improved morale. Nurturing happiness among employees can pay dividends on multiple fronts. In general, an employee that enjoys exercise time with a co-worker will make time to do it, cutting down on costly sick days. A study published in Health Affairs suggests that employers save $2.73 for every dollar spent on wellness through decreased employee absenteeism. And that doesn’t calculate the financial gains that come through long-term employee retention. Happy employees tend to remain in their positions longer, reducing turnover and training costs. Over time, wellness programs have a direct correlation to increased production since healthier, more energetic employees also benefit from better concentration.

Fewer claims and lower overall healthcare costs. Wellness programs have proven to produce healthier, more engaged employees. But they have also been shown to reduce an employer’s up-front premiums for healthcare coverage as risk factors such as weight, high blood pressure and tobacco use decrease. Employees who take a proactive approach to their health and fitness will tend to file fewer health insurance claims or disability claims, which can represent significant annual savings.

Fewer acute and chronic health conditions. The RX2Live program goes beyond a focus on only exercise and activity to offer nutritional advice and exercise regimens designed to reduce stress. Ours offers powerful tools for employees to live a healthier lifestyle, and if needed, lose extra weight. The result is fewer strokes, heart attacks and cases of diabetes. Long-term, a fitter staff also makes for fewer cases of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity and other chronic conditions. The goal is to prevent chronic health conditions and for those with those conditions, help them effectively manage them.

Across the board, whether measuring from a morale or financial metric, corporate wellness programs have proven to improve productivity and job satisfaction. For more information on the RX2Live workplace wellness program, visit our website: https://www.rx2live.com/.
